HistDAWass 0.1.8 What's new
===========================

(Histogram-valued Data analysis using Wasserstein metric)
---------------------------------------------------------

Now, a set of methods for MatH (WH.SSQ, WH.vec.mean, and all the methods using them) are much faster. We are using Rcpp and RcppArmadillo for improving execution time and precision of results.

HistDAWass 0.1.7 What's new
===========================

(Histogram-valued Data analysis using Wasserstein metric)
---------------------------------------------------------

Some general improvements have been added for reducing elaboration times.

> unsupervised learning

WH\_kmeans now returns more informative outputs

> principal components analysis

Multiple factor analysis has new functions for plotting results

HistDAWass 0.1.6 What's new
===========================

(Histogram-valued Data analysis using Wasserstein metric)
---------------------------------------------------------

> unsupervised learning

fuzzy c-means and kohonen maps are 10 times faster

HistDAWass 0.1.5 What's new
===========================

(Histogram-valued Data analysis using Wasserstein metric)
---------------------------------------------------------

> some minor bug fixed

HistDAWass 0.1.4 What's new
===========================

(Histogram-valued Data analysis using Wasserstein metric)
---------------------------------------------------------

> some minor bug fixed

HistDAWass 0.1.3 What's new
===========================

Some fixes to the worksapce

HistDAWass 0.1.2 What's new
===========================

(Histogram-valued Data analysis using Wasserstein metric)
---------------------------------------------------------

> From raw data to histograms

A new function was added for generating a histogram from a set of raw data

> Visualization

Now for plotting, `ggplot2` package is used generally.

A new plot for visualizing Histogram Time Series was added.

A new plot for comparing obversed vs predicted histogram was added.

A new plot for showing the differences between an observed and a predicted histogram was added.

> Regression and predictive techniques

A new function for computing Goodness of Fit of a model was added
