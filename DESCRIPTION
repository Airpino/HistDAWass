Description: In the framework of Symbolic Data Analysis, a relatively new approach 
          to the statistical analysis of multi-valued data, we consider histogram-valued data, i.e.,
          data described by univariate histograms. The  methods and the basic statistics for 
          histogram-valued data are mainly based 
          on the L2 Wasserstein metric between distributions, i.e., a Euclidean metric 
          between quantile functions. The package contains unsupervised classification techniques, 
          least square regression and tools for histogram-valued data and for histogram time series.
